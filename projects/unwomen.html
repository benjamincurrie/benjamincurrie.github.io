            UN Women is the United Nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women, and I was lucky enough to work with their Australian office to integrate and develop their brand new website.

            UN Women is a large reaching organisation with thousands of constituents, donations, pledges and volunteers and hundreds of events every year. They needed something to manage all this information as well as their communication mediums (Blog, Facebook, Twitter and E-Newsletter). Being a non-profit I attempted to use existing technologies as much as possible keeping development time to a minimum. The site was built using Drupal with CiviCRM heavily modified to manage their Events and Constituents.
