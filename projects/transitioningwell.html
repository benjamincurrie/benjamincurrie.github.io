            Transitioning Well is a service that aids business professionals in their transitions between carenthood, retirement and career changes.

            The Transitioning Well team wanted a bold, fullscreen layout utilising modal popups to layer information on the page. It was a challenging concept but I was able to come up with a custom Wordpress theme that utilised shortcodes for the team to be able to add new buttons and modal popups without having to understand the complex markup that the theme needed.
