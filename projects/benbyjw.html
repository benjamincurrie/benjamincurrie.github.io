            Ben by Jeremy Wallace is a bespoke suit and formal wear brand based out of New York City.

            All layout and design was provided by <a href="http://www.imagemotion.com/">Imagemotion</a> and my role was to translate this elegant design into a mobile friendly HTML5 site. Ben by JW is all about experience and we made the decision to use page transitions to enhance the users experience. To do this I built a custom light weight PHP and Javascript framework that uses Ajax and JS pushState to load in new pages but will still fall back to standard HTTP requests for older browsers and Web Crawlers making it both user friendly and SEO ready.
