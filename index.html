					<h3>Messaging Platform</h3>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					Clear communication between Booking.com's accommodation partners and their guests is paramount for a successful stay. Prior to their trip a guest might want to communicate with someone in order to make a request or get clarity on a topic. The current way to do this was not ideal, either through email which was slow or via phone which meant the guest had no record of the conversation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Booking.com Messaging Platform was born out of a need for a quick communication tool between the guest and accommodation partner, it was required to be accessible across all devices so we designed, built and launched across both web and native apps at the same time.

This introduced new complexities since email supports more complex elements such as formatting and images, so we were required to design solutions for these cases."

					<h3>Customer Support Portal</h3>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					<!-- I get by with a little help from my friends. -->
					While we never think something will go wrong when we make a purchase or book something, unfortunately sometimes it does and that's when Booking.com's award winning customer service comes in. Our customer service is one of the top reasons our customers continually choose Booking.com to book their stays. But it's not always clear to a guest how and where they should get help. Do I call customer service? Should I message the property? Can I find the answer online? The Customer Support Portal was created to answer those questions and point the guest in the right direction when they need help. Through research we understood the most common help topics and built a streamlined flow that allowed users to find answers quickly.
				</p>
				<p>
					The CS Portal was designed around natural language processing pioneered by the Messaging Platform, it allowed users to ask a question and an algorithm would detect what topics they were likely asking about. Based on the topic we then suggested whether it would be better for them to contact our Customer Service or the Accommodation, we offered various channels of communication (phone, email, messaging) and suggested which might be the most appropriate.

					<h3>Hostels</h3>

				<p>
					Booking.com was originally created in 1996 (then called bookings.nl) to connect travellers with Hotels and for over 20 years it focussed primarily on the Hotel market with huge success. Through years of experimentation the product had been highly optimised for Booking.com's primary audience (a party of two looking for a double room in a hotel). To continue to grow Booking needed to look for new opportunities and created a team dedicated to improving the experience for Hostels and the Backpacker segment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through initial research it became clear that a "backpacker" traveller had very different needs than our other customers. Backpackers were willing to forgo or share certain amenities in order to save money, so we made it easier to find shared low cost dorm rooms. Privacy and safety was a primary concern so we highlighted how many people rooms and bathrooms were shared with. We worked with our hostel partners to collect new information such as bathroom details, lockers, privacy curtains.
